appropriate technology help user find remote lost project manager add minute project folder id present component concept ui present user interface concept marketing expert need find information current trend led used light remote using sparsely mobile phone could bring cost would good idea integrate mechanism finding remote control user loses latter would preferable implementing backlight remote single large round button used volume channel selection using four separate quadrant another button switch two channel could also implemented remote also include volume program selection speech recognition recharging cradle added compensate extra energy consumption led would signify extra energy consumption powersaving led available could expensive difficult choose technique find lost remote install special button tv using special signal like clapping tricky need differentiated normal sound similarly using extra base station would probably costly adding feature may complicate design escalate cost challenge regarding need digit channel based fact often used also look dull despite customer may want remote furthermore designed attractive way discussion also focused replacement speech recognition latter help locating remote well however solution may prove expensive expanded target group may taken account order achieve projected sale profit
